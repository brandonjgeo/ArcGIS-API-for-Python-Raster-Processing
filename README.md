# ArcGIS API for Python: Raster Processing
ArcGIS API for Python is a Python library for working with maps and geospatial data, powered by web GIS. It provides simple and efficient tools for deep learning, sophisticated vector and raster analysis, geocoding, map making, routing and directions, as well as for organizing and managing a GIS with users, groups and information items. In addition to working with your own data, the library enables access to ready to use maps and curated geographic data from Esri and other authoritative sources. It also integrates well with the scientific Python ecosystem and includes rich support for Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Fast.ai, etc. and Jupyter notebook.

To learn more about the API, visit the product page [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/). You can get in touch with the developers of the API and other users like you at the community page [here](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/arcgis-python-api/).
